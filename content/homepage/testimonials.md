> Ari was the primary cook for our home for the whole 1.5 years we lived together.
> He made such a spread of mouthwatering savory dinners the likes of which I'd never had before. Because I am a vegetarian, the cooking for us was too, and despite being relatively new to that restriction, everything tasted as if he'd practiced it 100 times.
> The dishes I still dream about tend to be homey / comfort food with plenty of butter, salt, and cheese. Think gourmet mac and cheese, Shepherd's (or Gardener's) pie, pesto pasta bakes, and just SO many soups.
> If you need some food to warm up your body and soul, look no further than Ari.

> Ari has made several dinners for myself and my partner, each better than the last. Having him cook for you is certainly worth it...
> I can confidently say his is some of the best home cooking you'll get.
