- **Meal Prep**: A batch of 8 delicious individually-packaged frozen meals. $100 vegetarian, $130 with meat. Free delivery in Downtown Berkeley.

- **Dinner Parties**: My standard pricing is $50/hour + the cost of ingredients. E.g. for an 8-person dinner party, this likely comes out to $150-200, depending on the menu.

- **Custom Arrangements**: If you'd like to discuss other cooking services, let's chat! I'm also bit of a mad economist, so I'm intrigued by custom pricing schemes.
