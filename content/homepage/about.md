What began in my mother's kitchen has evolved into a lifelong love affair with creating exceptional food. You'll find me in constant motion – stirring a sauce while prepping vegetables, adjusting seasonings while planning the next course, all with an enthusiastic smile on my face. The controlled chaos of a busy kitchen isn't just my comfort zone – it's where I thrive.
My culinary journey has taken me from the bustling markets of Mexico to the sushi counters of Japan and the refined bistros of France, each place deepening my appreciation for the transformative power of food. But my favorite moment, whether I'm crafting a dish inspired by my travels or putting my own spin on a classic, is that first bite. There's nothing quite like watching someone experience my food for the first time. That look of delight, that contented "mmm" – it's what drives me to continuously push my culinary boundaries.
Now, as your private chef, I bring this passion and expertise to your table. My cooking philosophy combines technical excellence with genuine joy, creating dishes that don't just feed the body, but nurture the soul.

### Specialties

I'm at my best when making big batches of hearty, single-dish foods (fantastic for feeding a crowd or enjoying leftovers for days) such as soups/stews, pastas, curries, and casseroles. When I cook for myself I usually include meat, but I'm totally comfortable with vegetarian cooking. I also make some pretty tasty desserts! My focus is making delicious food, with less emphasis on health. I enjoy opportunities to expand my repertoire, so if you're looking for a different style or have dietary restrictions, let's chat about what I can do for you!
