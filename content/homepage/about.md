I'm obsessed with food, always have been. I fantasize about delicious meals and idly rotate flavors in my mind. To support my habit of eating delicious food, I started cooking long ago, and I've been refining my skills ever since. Now, I want to share my expertise with you!

I'm at my best when making big batches of hearty, single-dish foods like soups/stews, pastas, curries, and casseroles. These days, most of my cooking is vegetarian. My focus is making delicious food, with less emphasis on health. I enjoy opportunities to expand my repertoire, so if you're looking for a different style or have dietary restrictions, let's chat about what I can do for you!

The primary service I offer is meal prep. I cook up a batch of something tasty, package it in individual portions, and deliver it to you frozen. Whenever you want a home-cooked meal, it's ready to go with just a few minutes in the microwave! I'm also available to cook for dinner parties and open to other arrangements.
